We are making a fucntionality of VScode sidebar
where are can add nested folders or file or show nested folder or file

If we click outside the box, it should hide the addition button for that we put onBlur in input tag

If we press Enter it should add the file or folder, for that we use onKeyDown and if e.keyCode = 13 means its Enter button pressed

To show nested loops we will use recursion

Main logic is inside Folder.js and we have already made a JSON of folders which is inside folderData.js
